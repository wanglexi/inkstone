Hello All !

I am a Chinese language teacher in France and I'd like to localize e.g. translate the INKSTONE application into French, so that french students would be allowed to benefit from this great application. 

Below is the original project by skishore.

Any good will to contribute and help are most welcomed !

Best ! 

Wang

### What's new

The app version that you're on is displayed on the main page below the
"Inkstone" title. If you don't see it there, you're at version 0.0.4
or earlier.

- Version 0.1.4 introduces "stroke-capped" character data, which is visually
  appealing and better for learning.
  [See here for more details about this change.](https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi/pull/32)
  It also includes many character and word list fixes, and it patches a
  critical bug on iOS 11.4 which caused the "Write" button to be invisible.
- Version 0.1.3 adds "clear canvas" and "blacklist word" options at the top of
  the writing page. It also makes the UI for changing the grade for a word
  more obvious, and improves handwriting recognition for the component "Êàê".
- Version 0.1.2 adds "Backup" and "Restore" options on the settings page.
  This feature can be also used to migrate data from one device to another.
  Imported lists are included in the backup.
- Version 0.1.1 adds a "clear all data" button and the option to rerun a
  stroke order animation by clicking on it.
- Version 0.1.0 adds an asset download pane and a canvas width setting.
- Version 0.0.8 adds support for
  [handwriting shortcuts](http://i.imgur.com/suDHz1v.gif).
- Version 0.0.7 makes it
  [easier to import word lists](https://www.skishore.me/inkstone/docs/format.html).
- Version 0.0.6 makes it possible to adjust scheduling settings freely.
- Version 0.0.5 includes the option to **study traditional characters**.

In addition to the features mentioned above, most versions include some fixes
and additions to the character data.
See the [Installing from binary](#installing-from-binary)
section for updated APKs, or
[download the app from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.id126c0rsxlvjwv18cf44u).

### Introduction

Inkstone is a mobile app for people who want to learn to read and
write Mandarin. It's **totally free**, **open-source**, and can be used
**without an Internet connection**! Inkstone is licensed under the
[GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
Although the app is still being developed, it has quite a few features:

- Tap for a hint, double-tap for a walkthrough
- Stroke recognition and automatic grading
- Spaced-repetition-based scheduling
- Help pages and stroke-order animations for every character
- Bundled word lists: radicals and all HSK levels
- Settings that give you control over scheduling
- Support for custom word lists

### Installing from binary

I've uploaded compiled Android APKs to Dropbox. Only use these
binaries if you trust me and Dropbox! The legal disclaimers in the
`LICENSE` file apply to these binaries as well: **there is no warranty
for this program, to the extent permitted by applicable law**. See that
file for full details. With those caveats stated, the pre-built
binaries are here:

- [Inkstone v. 0.1.4 for Android armv7](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sdobc0hvnidbjna/inkstone-armv7.apk?dl=1)
- [Inkstone v. 0.1.4 for Android x86](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hfo7rdp0pjghtnw/inkstone-x86.apk?dl=1)

Most Android phones use armv7. Trying to install the APK for the wrong
architecture will just result in an error message, so if you're not sure
which one your phone is, try both.

### Building from source

To build Inkstone,
[install the latest version of Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/install),
then check out this repository and run:

    $ meteor build .build --server localhost:3785
    $ cp -R cordova-build-override/* .build/android/project/assets/.
    $ pushd .build/android/project/cordova
    $ ./build --release
    $ popd

If the build goes successfully, you'll end up with APKs in:

    ./build/android/project/build/outputs/apk/

You'll have to sign these APKs before they can be installed on a device.
See `scripts/build` for an example that also signs the APKs.
Note that the `--server` parameter in the `meteor build` command is a dummy.
Other than custom-lists downloads, the app is an entirely-client-side app.

### Supported platforms

Inkstone is available for both Android and iOS.
Since sideloading apps on iOS requires jailbreaking or recompiling,
I have only provided pre-built Android binaries.
[I have also made the app available on both the App Store and on Google Play.](https://www.skishore.me/inkstone/)

### Open source credits

[Inkstone was made possible by a number of other open-source projects,
a full listing of which can be found here.](https://www.skishore.me/inkstone/docs/credits.html)

### Upcoming features

See `todo.txt` for a list of planned features. If there's something you'd
like to see added that's not in that file, open an issue or drop me an email
at `kshaunak "at" gmail.com`.
